## About

I'm a PhD student working on frequency-domain, high-resolution Full Waveform Inversion with finite elements powered by domain decomposition methods.
My daily work focuses on coupling state-of-the-art DDMs with an inversion code to produce high quality 3D reconstructions using supercomputers. I have broad fields of interest, including other discretizations of the Helmholtz equations, GPU-suitable algorithms, nonlinear optimization, iterative linear solvers in general as well as multiphysics problems.

## Comparison of substructured non-overlapping domain decomposition and overlapping additive Schwarz methods for large-scale Helmholtz problems with multiple sources

We compare non-overlapping Optimized Schwarz Methods (OSM) based on substructuring with Lagrange Multipliers representing Robin traces with Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz preconditionners (with overlap) for the Helmholtz equation. We show on large problem (up to 600 million unknowns) that the non-overlapping approach is more efficient due to the substructuring and the absence of overlap, with only a small tradeoff in terms of convergence. This is particularly suited for solves with multiple right-hand-sides, which occur frequently in FWI.
Joint work with Pierre Jolivet and Christophe Geuzaine.

## Development

As part of my PhD, I maintain our finite element and domain decompisition codes [GmshFEM](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/fem) and [GmshDDM](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh). I'm also working on extending the mesg generator (Gmsh)[https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh] to make it suitable for large-scale parallel applications. This includes handling overlapping partitioning.
